      "3. Administration: The Ottoman Empire was a centralized state with a complex administrative system.

The empire also had a powerful bureaucracy, including the imperial court and various ministries.\n",

      "5. Military: The Ottoman military was one of the most powerful in the world during its time. It included infantry, cavalry, and naval forces, and was known for its discipline, organization, and tactical genius.

      "6. Cultural achievements: The Ottoman Empire was a major center of culture, art, and literature.
